Description: This package provides functions to fit a simple linear regression model 
    with a single numerical predictor and response variable. The package calculates
    model parameters such as slope and intercept, performs statistical tests 
    (t-test and F-test), computes R-squared and adjusted R-squared values, 
    and provides residual analysis. User-friendly functions for printing 
    and plotting results are included.
